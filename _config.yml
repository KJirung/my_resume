          This application aims to prevent QR code phishing by embedding malicious URLs, redirecting users to harmful sites when they scan the QR code.
          I was responsible for collecting URL data, feature investigation, data preprocessing, model training, data analysis, and app integration.
          Using a simple DNN model, I performed classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.9 for model performance.

          This application is designed for foreign tourists. It detects food in photos taken of Korean cuisine and classifies the detected dishes to provide users with brief information about each item.
          I was responsible for data collection and generation, model training, implementing OpenMax, and integrating the model with the app.
          The food detection model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.97 at IoU 50, while the food classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.9.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
