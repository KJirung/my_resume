          This application aims to prevent QR code phishing by embedding malicious URLs, redirecting users to harmful sites when they scan the QR code.
          I was responsible for collecting URL data, feature investigation, data preprocessing, model training, data analysis, and app integration.
          Using a simple DNN model, I performed classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.9 for model performance.

          This application is designed for foreign tourists. It detects food in photos taken of Korean cuisine and classifies the detected dishes to provide users with brief information about each item.
          I was responsible for data collection and generation, model training, implementing OpenMax, and integrating the model with the app.
          The food detection model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.97 at IoU 50, while the food classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.9.

          This project utilizes the OpenPose model to extract joint coordinates from video frames of jump rope exercises. 
          Based on this data, we measure the number of jump rope repetitions and conduct odds ratio analysis, SHAP analysis, and correlation analysis on the joint coordinates involved in the jump rope movement to derive insights.

          This project uses the public library statistical data provided by the Korean Library Statistics System to predict the material acquisition costs for the following year. 
          It also conducts SHAP analysis, Canonical Correlation Analysis, and correlation analysis on public library usage factors to analyze the relationship with next year's material acquisition costs and derive new insights.

        title: Development of a Novel Federated Learning Methodology for Endoscopic Image Segmentation
           
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Medical data is highly sensitive, and therefore, hospitals and medical institutions face legal constraints, such as data privacy regulations, when transmitting data to external servers. 
          Federated learning addresses these issues while maintaining the performance of model training. 
          This project aims to develop a federated learning technique that outperforms existing methods such as FedAvg, MA, and IPA. 
          Currently, we are conducting experiments to effectively process the weights transmitted from local servers on a central server while preserving the model's performance.

          I am participating in various research projects as an undergraduate researcher in this laboratory. 
          Currently, I am applying various analytical techniques, such as SHAP analysis, odds ratio analysis, correlation analysis, and canonical correlation analysis, to the data to derive insights. 
          Additionally, I am conducting research on applying a novel federated learning method to medical image segmentation models.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
